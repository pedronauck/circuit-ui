# Media queries

To use the media query utilities provided by Circuit themes, you'll use a
function provided by the theme called `theme.mq`.

```javascript
import styled, { css } from 'react-emotion';

const ResponsiveDiv = styled('div')`
  ${({ theme }) => css`
    ${theme.mq.mega`
      padding-top: ${theme.spacings.peta};
    `};    
  `};
`;
```

## Breakpoints

You can use the following breakpoints when implementing either components
inside Circuit UI or writing code that should be theme-compliant in your app.

<MediaQueriesTable/>

## Responsive best practices

- Do not refer directly to `theme.breakpoints`, but instead use the named
  media query helpers.
