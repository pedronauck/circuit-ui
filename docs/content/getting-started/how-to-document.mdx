import { Playground } from 'docz'

import OriginalButton from '../../../src/components/Button/Button';
import PropTable from '../../utils/PropTable';

import Button from '../components/DocButton';

# Documenting a component
A component needs to have a basic description, prop table, and playground to showcase behavior. It's also a good idea to provide usage scenarios and include multiple playgrounds with different props.

## How To: Description
You can extract component description by using a utility function `getDescription` in `utils/service`. It requires a default exported component.

```
<div>
	{getDescription(OriginalButton)}
</div>
```

## How To: PropTable
We have created a custom prop table component, which you can find in `docs/utils` folder. It requires a default exported component, so that `react-docgen` dependency can properly parse the PropTypes.
```
 import OriginalButton from '../../../src/components/Button/Button';
 import PropTable from '../../utils/PropTable';

 <div>
 	<PropTable component={OriginalButton} />
 </div>
```
the result looks like this:

 <div>
 	<PropTable component={OriginalButton} />
 </div>

 ## How To: Playground

 The Playground component requires the button to be wrapped in ThemeProvider (this will change in the future). Therefore we create a `DocButton.js` file, where the component is wrapped in a ThemeProvider.

 ```
import { Playground } from 'docz'

import Button from './DocButton';

<Playground>
  	<Button primary> Button </Button>
</Playground>

 ```
the end result will look like:

<Playground>
  	<Button primary> Button </Button>
</Playground>

## Known Issues
Docz is still relatively unstable (current version is 0.59), and there are some bugs that are getting fixed. Here is a list of bugs and workarounds we found for them.

### Custom Wrappers
 As of version 0.59, there is a bug that does not allow to create custom wrappers (like Redux store or theme providers) for Playground components.
This forces us to create a separate component and wrap it with `<ThemeProvider>` for use in Playground. See `docs/components/DocButton.js`

### PropsTable
There is an issue with Docz's PropsTable component, which forced us to create our own. We might get rid of it in the future.

### Document Order
The document ordering is complicated, and being currently worked on. See [this issue](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/issues/143).

### Slow Scrolling
In Safari there might be slower scrolling. Try using another browser or wait for a fix. See [this issue](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/issues/122).
